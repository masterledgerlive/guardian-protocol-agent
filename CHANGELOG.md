## Unreleased

### Fixed — live USD quotes (MORPHO / KITE / LUNA / GAME / UNKNOWN ENTRY)

Production was treating missing prices as $0, which poisoned wave prediction and tier scores.

- Corrected Base contract typos: MORPHO, LUNA, GAME, MOCHI. Catalog addresses are now authoritative on GitHub load (saved `tokens.json` cannot override a wrong contract).
- KITE's configured Base address has no DexScreener/GeckoTerminal market. It is disabled and skipped with a clear log rather than traded on an invented quote.
- Price path now prefers DexScreener (highest-liquidity Base pair) and GeckoTerminal in chunks of 10. The previous GT batch of 28+ addresses returned HTTP 400 or silently kept only ~10 prices.
- Boot scan / unknown holdings resolve from the live market + on-chain balance. Never logs `val≈$0.00` when a market price exists. If still unquoted, the token is marked `UNKNOWN` and excluded from margin math.
- Buys/sells/prediction skip when no real USD quote is available. No $0.000001 dummy entries.
